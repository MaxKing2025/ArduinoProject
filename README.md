# ArduinoProject
I used a relay module (output) to click on/off when I typed various keys on the keyboard (input)
wired the relay to the Arduino board through "gnd"
used key-type action to power an LED that I soldered to the circuit 
comprehension and construction of code necessary to setup LED pins to characters (H, L, P, M, Q, W, Z, X)
further code attached in project
