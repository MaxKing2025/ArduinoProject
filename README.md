# ArduinoProject
I used a relay module (output) to click on/off when I typed various keys on the keyboard (input)
wired the relay to the arduino board through "gnd"
used keytype action to power an led that I soldered to the circuit 
comprehension and construction of code nessessary to setup LED pins to characters (H,L,P,M,Q,W,Z,X)
